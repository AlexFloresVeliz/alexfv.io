# Portfolio Website :globe_with_meridians:

It is becoming more and more important to create a personal brand in order to build a reputation for your specific talents and services. I decided to create a website to promote what skills I can offer a team or business.

Although it looks good on most mobile devices, I plan on making the site responsive for phones of all kinds of sizes in the future. Gotta show love to all the phones 📱
